				<h3>The Legendary Origins of Tea</h3>
				<p>The history of tea extends so far into the past that its very origins
				are shrouded by legend.  It is said that Emperor Shen Nung, who ruled China
				in 2700 BC, used to enjoy relaxing in his garden with a cup of hot water.
				It was during one of these respites that a tea leaf happened to float down
				from a nearby bush, and land directly in the Emperor’s cup.

				The new drink quickly became the Emperor’s favorite, and a taste for tea
				quickly spread throughout the aristocracy, and it wasn’t long before tea
				was the favored drink throughout all of China.</p>
				<p>It was in the 16<sup>th</sup> century that Portuguese missionaries were
				seduced by tea’s flavor and the intricate customs which surrounded it.  A
				demand for the drink quickly arose, and the Dutch East India Company began
				importing it into Europe.</p>
				<p>It’s most likely that it was the Japanese green teas which were first to
				arrive in the west, owing to Japan’s liberal trade policies with the Dutch.
				Initially, tea was chiefly recommended to Europeans for its purported
				medicinal qualities; it was claimed by the Dutch that tea was a cure for
				nearly every disease imaginable.</p>
				<p>Due to the expense of bringing tea halfway across the globe, it was
				initially consumed primarily by aristocrats and the rich.  Over time the
				cost of tea fell enough for people from all walks of life to be able to
				enjoy it.  By 1717 Thomas Twining’s English coffee house became a tea shop;
				and unlike the ubiquitous London coffee houses of the era, the doors of
				Twining’s were open to both men and women.  Meeting friends over tea became
				a staple of British life, and afternoon tea became a lasting tradition that
				still continues today.</p>
