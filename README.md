Work done in school.

Example of XHTML 1.0 Strict.

Not too sure why we had to use that doctype.

I think the teacher wanted us to use the default settings in DreamWeaver if I
remember correctly.

Anyway, the .PSD was provided, as well as the images.  I had to hand-code the
`index.html` and the `syle.css` files.
