Example of an XHTML 1.0 Strict document.

Not too sure why we had to use this specific doctypeâ€¦  I think the teacher
wanted us to use the default settings in Dreamweaver if my memory serves my
right.

The .psd was provided, as well as the images.  I had to hand-code the
`index.html` and the `style.css` files.
