Example of an XHTML 1.0 Strict document.

Not too sure why we had to use that specific doctype.

I think the teacher wanted us to use the default settings in DreamWeaver, if my
memory serves my right.

Anyway, the .PSD was provided, as well as the images.  I had to hand-code the
`index.html` and the `style.css` files.
